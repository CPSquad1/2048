## üí° Implementation Guidelines

### Game Logic

**Grid Representation**
```javascript
// Use a 2D array to represent the grid
let grid = [
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0]
];
```

**Movement Algorithm**
1. Filter out zeros from the row/column
2. Merge adjacent equal values
3. Fill remaining positions with zeros
4. Update the grid and UI

**Win/Loss Conditions**
- Win: Any tile reaches 2048
- Loss: No empty cells AND no adjacent tiles with same value

### Theme Implementation

**CSS Variables Approach**
```css
:root {
  --bg-color: #faf8ef;
  --text-color: #776e65;
  --grid-bg: #bbada0;
  /* ... more variables */
}

.dark-theme {
  --bg-color: #1a1a1a;
  --text-color: #f0f0f0;
  --grid-bg: #2c2c2c;
  /* ... dark theme overrides */
}
```

**Theme Toggle**
- Use JavaScript to add/remove `dark-theme` class from body
- Save preference in `localStorage`
- Apply saved theme on page load

### Animations
- Tile appearance: scale or fade-in effect
- Tile movement: smooth position transitions
- Tile merge: pop or pulse animation
- Use CSS `transition` and `@keyframes`

---

## üìè Code Standards

### HTML
- Use semantic tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`)
- Include proper ARIA labels for accessibility
- Validate using [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

### CSS
- Use meaningful class names (BEM methodology preferred)
- Group related properties together
- Add comments for complex sections
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Avoid `!important` unless absolutely necessary

### JavaScript
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use ES6+ features (arrow functions, template literals)
- Handle errors gracefully
- No `console.log()` in final submission (or use conditionally)

### Example Naming Conventions
```javascript
// Variables: camelCase
let currentScore = 0;

// Functions: camelCase with verb
function initializeGame() { }

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
const GRID_SIZE = 4;

// Classes: PascalCase
class GameManager { }
```
